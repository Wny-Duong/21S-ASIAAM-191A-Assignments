        <p>
            I'm Wilny. I'm a fourth year CS major graduating in Spring 2021. I have the minimum amount of
            HTML/CSS/JS experience needed to say that I can read the code. I also like hiking and drawing (I drew both of the images you can see on this GitHub page. The process for the Royce Hall one looks like a nightmarish pile of Adobe Illustrator layers.
            My current goals as a critical digital map marker
            are learning how to use maps on my personal web projects, how to use those maps in a productive and helpful manner to society,
            and also to use maps to create and showcase meaningful narratives of some kind (whether simply for fun or to highlight issues and solve problems).
        </p>

        <a href="https://www.kanopy.com/">Kanopy: A free service associated with the UCLA Library system to provide you with access to socially-relevant documentaries, historically-significant films, and that's really all it does honestly. It's basically academic Netflix. </a>
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/DEFAULT.asp"> It makes sense to cite w3schools here since I used it to troubleshoot why my HTML and JS weren't working right at first. </a>
